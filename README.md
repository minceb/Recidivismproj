# Recidivismproj
This is a project I worked on with a group in intro to data science.
We were tasked to do an analysis to create a predictive model to see if criminals would recidivise. We ended up creating two models: A logistic regressiona and a random forest.
Both were comparable in predicting a testing dataset but the forest model definetly overfit the training dataset more so than the logistic regression.
